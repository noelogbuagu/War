Start with 52 card deck 
spilt into 2 equal halves for 2 players
each player grabs a card from the deck and displays that card
the card with the higher ranking wins
the player that had the higher ranking card adds all displayed cards to their deck
if displayed card is of equal value, then war occurs
war involves each player removing a subset of cards from the deck (2-5)
from this subset, each player draws another card
the player with the higher ranking card, takes the subset of cards and the displayed cards of the losing player
this cycle continues until there are no cards left for one player
that player will be the loser
